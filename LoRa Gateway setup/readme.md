# LoRaWAN Gateway Setup. 

### Indoor Gateways

These are intended to be distributed to each participant in the bike scheme and installed at their premises so that their bikes can at least connect and upload data when they are at base.
However, coverage is quite good, stretching a few hundred feet from each premises.  
Setup is very simple and takes around 5 minutes per gateway. They need to connect to Wi-fi access points for upstream connectivity and from there they go to the Things Network for aggregation.


### Tektelic outdoor gateways
These are bigger, much more expensive and more powerful with longer range and are more configurable too. Put fewer of them around to cover larger areas of the city with, ideally, line of sight coverage.
